# google-homepage

MOTIVATION:
This website is a part of the The Odin' Project's (TOP) suggested projects for the foundation path to learn HTML and CSS. The assignment was to recreate the Google homepage. It focuses on how the elements are placed, as well as style and alignment. 

DESIGN CHOICES:
I chose to use CSS flexbox for aligning the elements on the page because I wished to learn this framework better. In the future, I would like to redesign the project using CSS grid to decide which alignment style I like better. 

WORKING PROCESS:
To begin, I completed this project using Windows as opposed to the Linux VM as TOP suggested. While I did go through the LINUX VM set-up on my desktop computer as suggested and can do the same steps with the LINUX command line, I primarily work on my laptop which does not have the memory/RAM to reliably support the LINUX VM. Through googling, I found that I can do the same steps within Windows, with creating files through the Windows command prompt being the only real hassle.

I first started by creating my file set-up and downloading the images I wanted. I then set-up a basic HTML file with list indexes for the header and footer navigation bars, a form for the input field and buttons, and the google image. I then started to align and style everything, using the documentation and Google Chrome dev tools to inspect the Google homepage where I didnt' understand something. I also set-up links for most of the buttons/links to the locations that actual Google homepage links to. 

LEARNING: 
I learned how to set-up an inline navigation bar that is fixed to the top or bottom. I can do this with either the list element or with just link references, but found the formatting more readable using just link references. 

I learned how to restyle the input field box to make a prettier style of box. This involved making the border of the original box transparent, and adding a new div element around the input with its own border and box-shadow. 

I learned about a new svg element, although I chose not to use it in this project. I felt that I would have been just copying and pasting the text into the file, which would not have helped me learn about how it is really used. I hope to better implement this feature in the future. 

DIFFICULTIES:
I am struggling with responsive design. When I tried to make the homepage responsive at smaller sizes, it would destroy the alignment of the full-size page. Most of the elements have hard-coded pixel sizes to try to match the Google homepage. I will practice more with both flexbox and grid alignment styles and responsive design. I plan to redesign this webpage when I have a better understanding of both.
